Project Step 2
#User Need Statement

This is a project for the MSSA program that accomplishes the following goals:

- Create an application that allows users to view different categories of essential oils.
- Pull data from database on oil ingredients and uses.

In the course of this project I will use ASP.NET and C# to build a program that will categorize
types of essential oils, specifically Young Living's essential oils. It will allow users to organize
the oils by single-ingredient oils and oil blends. It will also allow users to pull data from database
to display specific oil ingredients and uses for each oil. Oils will be listed in alphabetical order to 
allow for users to easily locate the oil they are searching for. Users will be able to search by name order
use a drop-down list to find the oil they are looking for.

The features of this project will include:

- Categorizes essential oils by 'Blends' and 'Single' oils.
- Pulls data from database to display ingredients and uses.
- Sorts data by alphabetical order.
- Provides users with 'search' option and 'drop-down' list option.
